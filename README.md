This project is a Telegram-based AI bot designed to detect fake news statements and AI-generated or manipulated images. Built using Python, the bot leverages natural language processing and computer vision to provide users with real-time analysis of the content they share. When a user sends a news headline or claim, the bot uses a pre-trained SentenceTransformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to convert the input into sentence embeddings. It then compares this embedding against search snippets retrieved via Google Custom Search from trusted news sources like BBC, CNN, The Guardian, and NDTV. Based on semantic similarity scores and sentiment keyword analysis, the bot determines whether the statement is likely true or false and returns relevant sources along with a confidence score and sentiment assessment.

In addition to text verification, the bot also supports AI image detection. Users can upload an image, with or without a caption, and the bot processes it through the Google Cloud Vision API’s Web Detection feature. It analyzes the detected web entities, their confidence scores, and variation to assess if the image is likely real, fake, or AI-generated. If a caption is provided, it further cross-checks it against top search results to see if the caption aligns with the detected entities in the image. This dual approach—combining semantic understanding of text and visual content analysis—makes the bot a powerful tool for combating misinformation.

The bot is implemented using the python-telegram-bot framework (v20+), along with sentence-transformers, torch, aiohttp, and requests. API keys from Google Cloud are required for both the Vision and Custom Search services. Once configured, the bot can be run locally and used via Telegram to instantly analyze news and media content. This project is ideal for students, developers, or researchers interested in misinformation detection, NLP, or AI-based Telegram integrations.
